# save-smart

## Sales Data Dashboard

This repository contains a dashboard created to analyze and visualize financial patterns amongst younger generations. The project demonstrates my skills in data analysis, data visualization, and business intelligence using Python and Tableau.

## Project Overview

- **Data Source**: Data was sourced from online google survey in January 2025
- **Tools Used**:xcel and tableau
  
- **Key Findings**:
A large percentile save at random because they are on a tight budget, lack financial discipline and are tempted to always spend. They also lack a strong motivation to save.

I recommend giving out a lot of information about finances and  incentivizing people that save with rewards and benefits.

App should also focus on automation, rewards and withdrawal anytime without penalty.
